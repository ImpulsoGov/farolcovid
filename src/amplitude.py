        is_new_page is a boolean telling if this event is the user moving to a new page, in which case the code

        in simulacovid). This is such that we can keep track of what option is chosen at the current moment by making the chosen option
        True and the rest False.

        For the rest of the events it will try to use the event_args object and detect any changes from the previous ones.
        If a change is detected it will log the event, if not it will ignore.
